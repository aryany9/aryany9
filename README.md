## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Aryan Yadav, A software engineer currently employed at an IT company, I am proud to have earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Science of Information Technology. My post-graduation education and hands-on experience as a full-stack developer have equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in this field.

üë®‚Äçüíª I am highly passionate about gaining knowledge and expertise in new technologies.

üé∏ In addition to my interest in technology, I am also motivated to acquire new abilities and capabilities beyond the realm of technology.

üìö Apart from technology, I am also an avid reader, particularly interested in books that focus on personal development and financial literacy. Two of my favorite books in these genres are "The Compound Effect" by Darren Hardy in the category of personal development and "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki in the category of financial literacy.
